Decentralized Web Game (Dapp) that enables the player to manage and control the training regime of a single gladiator (eating, sleeping and training). The game utilizes a built-in cryptocurrency which is based on ethereum - ERC20 custom token. The player's decisions act as transactions which affect his total balance and rank.
